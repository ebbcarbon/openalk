# OpenAlk

[![Tests](https://github.com/ebbcarbon/openalk/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ebbcarbon/openalk/actions)

OpenAlk is a low-cost system for measuring total alkalinity of seawater samples utilizing a combination of off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software, meant to increase the convenience, speed, and accessibility of alkalinity measurement. The system generally follows the process outlined in Dickson [SOP 3B](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/ocean-carbon-acidification-data-system/oceans/Handbook_2007.html) for determining alkalinity by open-cell titration.

## User Guide

Instructions for setting up the hardware and installing the software can be found in the [user guide](docs/userguide.pdf), along with
SOP documents detailing basic benchtop usage and a bill of materials (BOM) showing what you'll need to get started.
